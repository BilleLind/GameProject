# Januar-game-project
the januar game projekt due 29-01-2020

this game uses multiple classes for different purposes, the instance variables are private so i am using getters and setters to get 
access to the variables or methods that uses the instance variables.
it is build using alot of if /if else and switch, using getters and setters to access values from different classes.'


the Game Class => where the method for running the different methods is in there, along with the retaliate and main combat class
Creature class => where some of Humans and Player instancevariables are drawn from
Humans class => where the enemies are created from
Player class => where the Player gets and sets it's health, attack, defence, equipment, weapon or check if it is still alive through it's isAlive();
Calculations class => where i have gathered all the calculations and made them static so it could be accessed from any class to employ with either the Humans or Player values.
Level classes => the class where all the methods for the different stories that i have written that i employ in the Game class as needed after or before combat and in the intro
Main class => only use it to run the Game class gameRunning(); did use it to test different values along the way
